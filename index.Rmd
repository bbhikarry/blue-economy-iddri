## Digital space

<!-- Quantify the scope of the problem and connect it to my audience . Achieve this in this slide by .panelset.sideways[] -->



Local Blue Economy is lacking a coherent/cohesive modern tech framework. Tourism can provide data gathering and information dissemination capacity well into the medium term. Win/Win!

## Aligning Blue with Tobago tourism

.left-column[ **Recreational Blue** 


![Marine adventuresM](index_files/figures/marineadv.jpeg)

]

.right-column[

### Key considerations 

  - Negative effects resulting from tourism can be observed on four different levels in a destination, namely: 
    * economic well-being, 
    * social well-being, 
    * cultural well-being and 
    * environmental well-being.

  - Tourism is the sector most affected by COVID. Tobago's recovery **will** see accelerated tourism. Its sustainable growth requires tech.

## Protecting our Blue: The pilot within the Pilot 

.left-column[
*Pterois volitans* poses a major and direct threat to ecologies, ecosystems and economies.  

![Getty Image](index_files/figures/lionfish.jpg)

It follows that actions to control lionfish is priority for the tourism sector.
]

.right-column[



#### Questions: 

  1. What is the likelihood of stemming the lionfish population curve before the habitats are destroyed? 
  1. What marine recreational activities might enable lionfish tracking, hunting (catching) and serving?
  1. If the probable outcome is bad in the near term why not bring in grouper from the Pacific?
  
>&#9798; Bring Grouper from the Maldives to Tobago (Joint activity) or at least do a desktop research on successful specie introductions 

&#9888; *Align our pilot project actions to IDDRI's sought outcome by tackling this threat to tourism and marine ecosystems*.

*Shades of Adele*.....  So. We have looked at two ideas which works with/for each other. Will they fit into the IDDRI parent project?. Let's compare Theory of Change against Logical Framework (Cos our pilots are for business development).

|OUTPUTS|1. **Online/On-ground multipart lionfish reduction campaign**||||
||2. Digital **portal enabling Onestop general knowledgebase as well as bookings** for rooms and tours ||||
|ACTIVITIES|1. **Creation of booking system** to improve 'blue oriented' customer base ||||  
||2. Lionfish food prep workshops, Responsible eating **Radio/TV/YouTube** show and other related digital strategies as advised||||
||3. **Responsible catch restaurants** listing (*menus*?)||||

## Plan for slideshow

Separate the mini-projects Lionfish and Get In Touch web like;

**Logical Frame for Lionfishery project**

Useful and well understood for project proposing, implementation and reporting


**Theory of Change for Website.**

TOC helps to diagrammatically keep the bigger picture in sight wcwn as the discussions delve down to resource acquisition, usage and reporting.

## Of importance

What do the beneficiary destinations get?

Each selected destination will obtain:

- A personalized diagnosis of its level of technological readiness, based on its main challenges (*prioritized by the destinations themselves*); 

- A detailed action and pre-investment plan (*agreed between the public and private sector*) to accelerate technological assimilation at the destination. 

.footnote[Ten (10) destinations will be selected from; Trinidad and Tobago, Argentina, Barbados, Bahamas, Belize, Brazil, Bolivia, Nicaragua, Mexico, Jamaica, Honduras, Haiti, Guyana, Guatemala, El Salvador, Ecuador, Costa Rica, Columbia and Chile.]

---
## Selection criteria

Applicant (beneficiary destinations) must have;

1. A tourism org (*like TTAL, THATA*)

1. Duly signed letters of interest from key stakeholder groups

1. A dedicated team with active private-public sector reps.

1. a diagnosis of the destination (*ESG considerations*)

1. a tourism plan *in force*

---

## Selection process

Applications will be evaluated and scored (*closest to 60 pts*)

## Blue Economy

“An economic activity that directly or indirectly uses ocean or river resources as an input, and that contributes or does not negatively affect the health and sustainability of ocean and river ecosystems. It emphasises conservation and sustainable management based on the idea that healthy ocean ecosystems are more productive and are fundamental to sustainable, ocean-based economies. Sustainable management implies that economic activity is in balance with the long-term capacity of ocean ecosystems to support such activity..”
