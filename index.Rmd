## Framing IDDRI Tobago pilot

<!-- Quantify the scope of the problem and connect it to my audience -->

>**Keywords**: Resilience, Competitiveness, Socio-environmental sustainability, Blue oriented tourism.

#### Local 'Blue' needs to be placed into a modern tech framework with data gathering and information dissemination at its core.

![Sustaiable development](index_files/figures/dtl.png)

Objectives: To **service the Keywords** and **embed ESG partnerships**.

## Pushing tourism into the Blue (responsibly)

.left-column[ Recreational  &nbsp; **B.E.**  


![arine adventuresM](index_files/figures/marineadv.jpeg)
Fishery type activities are missing. One oh  momento.
]

.right-column[
Tourism is the sector most affected by COVID. Country recovery **will** see accelerated tourism. Its sustainable growth requires tech.
]

---

## Protecting our Blue 

.left-column[
*Pterois volitans* poses a major and direct threat to ecologies, ecosystems and economies.  

![Getty Image](index_files/figures/lionfish.jpg)

It follows that actions to control lionfish (*population*) become priority for the tourism sector.
]

.right-column[*Note to self*:
Balance pilot project actions by tackling this threat to Blue tourism and local marine ecological systems.

*Hint*:  Several marine recreational activities enable lionfish tracking, hunting (catching) and serving.

*Questions*: 

  1. What is the likelihood of stemming the lionfish population curve before the habitats are destroyed? 
  1. If the probable outcome is bad why not bring in grouper (fish) from the Pacific?
  
>**Possible project action**: Bring Grouper from the Maldives to Tobago (Joint activity) or ar least do a desktop research on successful specie introductions

## Plan for slideshow

Separate the mini-projects Lionfish and Get In Touch web like;

**Logical Frame for Lionfishery project**

Useful and well understood for project proposing, implementation and reporting


**Theory of Change for Website.**

TOC helps to diagrammatically keep the bigger picture in sight wcwn as the discussions delve down to resource acquisition, usage and reporting.

## Of importance

What do the beneficiary destinations get?

Each selected destination will obtain:

- A personalized diagnosis of its level of technological readiness, based on its main challenges (*prioritized by the destinations themselves*); 

- A detailed action and pre-investment plan (*agreed between the public and private sector*) to accelerate technological assimilation at the destination. 

.footnote[Ten (10) destinations will be selected from; Trinidad and Tobago, Argentina, Barbados, Bahamas, Belize, Brazil, Bolivia, Nicaragua, Mexico, Jamaica, Honduras, Haiti, Guyana, Guatemala, El Salvador, Ecuador, Costa Rica, Columbia and Chile.]

---
## Selection criteria

Applicant (beneficiary destinations) must have;

1. A tourism org (*like TTAL, THATA*)

1. Duly signed letters of interest from key stakeholder groups

1. A dedicated team with active private-public sector reps.

1. a diagnosis of the destination (*ESG considerations*)

1. a tourism plan *in force*

---

## Selection process

Applications will be evaluated and scored (*closest to 60 pts*)

## Blue Economy

“An economic activity that directly or indirectly uses ocean or river resources as an input, and that contributes or does not negatively affect the health and sustainability of ocean and river ecosystems. It emphasises conservation and sustainable management based on the idea that healthy ocean ecosystems are more productive and are fundamental to sustainable, ocean-based economies. Sustainable management implies that economic activity is in balance with the long-term capacity of ocean ecosystems to support such activity..”
