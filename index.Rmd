##  Tourism and digitisation (Hand in glove)

<!-- Quantify the scope of the problem and connect it to my audience -->



<img src="index_files/figures/thumbs-down.png",width='15', height='15'/>  Local Blue Economy is lacking a coherent/cohesive modern tech framework.   
Tourism can provide data gathering and information dissemination capacity well into the medium term. <img src="index_files/figures/thumbs-up.png",width='15', height='15'/>

## Aligning Tobago tourism with global BLUE

.left-column[ **Blue recreation**  


![Marine adventuresM](index_files/figures/marineadv.jpeg)

]

.right-column[

### Consider...

Negative effects resulting from tourism can be observed on different levels namely; 

  * the island's economic well-being, 
  * the population's social well-being, 
  * its cultural well-being and
  * its environmental well-being.

Tourism is the sector most affected by COVID. Tobago's recovery **will** see accelerated tourism. 
  * Sustainable growth requires tech to walk the talk

## Protect Blue: Pilot within pilot

.left-column[
*Pterois volitans* poses a major and direct threat to ecologies, ecosystems and economies.  

![Getty Image](index_files/figures/lionfish.jpg)

It follows that actions to control lionfish is priority for the tourism sector.
]

.right-column[



#### Questions: 

  1. What is the likelihood of stemming the lionfish population curve before the habitats are destroyed? 
  1. What marine recreational activities might enable lionfish tracking, hunting (catching) and serving?
  1. If the probable outcome is bad in the near term why not bring in grouper from the Pacific?  
  1. Gender balance in the proposed fishery?
  
>&#9798; Bring Grouper from the Maldives to Tobago (Joint activity) or at least do a desktop research on successful specie introductions 

&#9888; *Align our pilot project actions to IDDRI's sought outcome by tackling this threat to tourism and marine ecosystems*.

]

???
Hashtag #ProtectBlue

Achieving Gender balance in the proposed fishery will require program funds in the early stages to access markets - allowing the business will be run by women. Further, technological assistance may be required in-project.

.panelset.sideways[

.panel[.panel-name[Step 1. Focus]

  *Focus is on high level change*.   
  
  A combo of two parts. Improved bookings And an SDG aware community (more tourists and a visible drive to predate lionfish in coastal waters)  
 ]   
    
.panel[.panel-name[Step 2. Needs]   

  >*What is needed for these things to happen*?  
  
  1. [**A digital hub**](#dtf) with relevant content for/and by, local community, businesses, homes and the respective travel markets. 
  
  1. A sustained **public awareness campaign** to kill/sell/buy/eat lionfish, seeking to ease grouper and snapper fishing.....
  
  1. **A business venture** dealing in 'responsibly' caught (and grown) foods for home, hospitality, health and school feeding sectors. To include the away market...
  

    ]

.panel[.panel-name[Step 3. Assumptions]

 >**Assumptions**: For portal & lionfishery      

  1. Third party bookings (f.e Expedia) is a credible model
  1. Online bookings (room and tour) will be positively impacted by a web application which;  
    - emphasises responsible use of resources to tourism stakeholders
    - sensitises the public to the threat that is *Pterois volitans*  
  1. Project impacts national policy and thinking; 
    - by placing natural lionfish predators (grouper and snapper) on a 'protected' list   
    - by selling 'responsibly' fished (lionfish and other species) via Internet  
  1. A Common booking module will
    - increase visibility of roomstock
    - allow (some) standardisation to global benchmarks
]

.panel[.panel-name[Step 3. . ... Risks]

>**Risks** - to both portal & lionfishery


  1. Can the cost of running the portal be covered solely by fees from participant businesses? 
  
  1. Will lionfish find fishtraps attractive?
  (so the processors can survive)
  
  1. Will fisherfolk will buy into the 'responsible' approach of leaving  natural lionfish predators to thrive?

## Of importance

What do the beneficiary destinations get?

Each selected destination will obtain:

- A personalized diagnosis of its level of technological readiness, based on its main challenges (*prioritized by the destinations themselves*); 

- A detailed action and pre-investment plan (*agreed between the public and private sector*) to accelerate technological assimilation at the destination. 

.footnote[Ten (10) destinations will be selected from; Trinidad and Tobago, Argentina, Barbados, Bahamas, Belize, Brazil, Bolivia, Nicaragua, Mexico, Jamaica, Honduras, Haiti, Guyana, Guatemala, El Salvador, Ecuador, Costa Rica, Columbia and Chile.]

---
## Selection criteria

Applicant (beneficiary destinations) must have;

1. A tourism org (*like TTAL, THATA*)

1. Duly signed letters of interest from key stakeholder groups

1. A dedicated team with active private-public sector reps.

1. a diagnosis of the destination (*ESG considerations*)

1. a tourism plan *in force*

---

## Selection process

Applications will be evaluated and scored (*closest to 60 pts*)

## Blue Economy 


>“An economic activity that directly or indirectly uses ocean or river resources as an input, and contributes or does not negatively affect the health and sustainability of ocean and river ecosystems. It emphasises conservation and sustainable management based on the idea that healthy ocean ecosystems are more productive and therefore fundamental to sustainable, ocean-based economies. Further, sustainable management implies that economic activity is in balance with the long-term capacity of ocean ecosystems to support such activity..”
