## Welcome

 We are here to discuss the Tobago implementation of the IDDRI [Blue Economy](#blu) Project

## Tobago's tourism space and digitisation

<!-- Quantify the scope of the problem and connect it to my audience . Achieve this in this slide by .panelset.sideways[] -->



<img src="index_files/figures/thumbs-down.png",width='15', height='15'/>  Local Blue Economy is lacking a coherent/cohesive modern tech framework.   
Tourism can provide data gathering and information dissemination capacity well into the medium term. <img src="index_files/figures/thumbs-up.png",width='15', height='15'/>

## Aligning Tobago tourism with global BLUE

.left-column[ ** Blue recreation**  


![Marine adventuresM](index_files/figures/marineadv.jpeg)

]

.right-column[

### Consider...

Negative effects resulting from tourism can be observed on different levels namely; 

  * the island's economic well-being, 
  * the population's social well-being, 
  * its cultural well-being and
  * its environmental well-being.

Tourism is the sector most affected by COVID. Tobago's recovery **will** see accelerated tourism. 
  * Sustainable growth requires tech to walk the talk

## ProtectBlue: Pilot within pilot

.left-column[
*Pterois volitans* poses a major and direct threat to ecologies, ecosystems and economies.  

![Getty Image](index_files/figures/lionfish.jpg)

It follows that actions to control lionfish is priority for the tourism sector.
]

.right-column[



#### Questions: 

  1. What is the likelihood of stemming the lionfish population curve before the habitats are destroyed? 
  1. What marine recreational activities might enable lionfish tracking, hunting (catching) and serving?
  1. If the probable outcome is bad in the near term why not bring in grouper from the Pacific?
  
>&#9798; Bring Grouper from the Maldives to Tobago (Joint activity) or at least do a desktop research on successful specie introductions 

&#9888; *Align our pilot project actions to IDDRI's sought outcome by tackling this threat to tourism and marine ecosystems*.

*Shades of Adele*.....  So. We have looked at a Lionfishery which works with/for the [IDDRI parent project?](#blu). Now for the Web portal aspect.

## Expanded view TOC for web portal

.panelset.sideways[

.panel[.panel-name[Step 1. Focus]

  *Focus is on high level change*.   
  
  A combo of two parts. Improved bookings And an SDG aware community (more tourists and a visible drive to predate lionfish in coastal waters)  
 ]   
    
.panel[.panel-name[Step 2. Needs]   

  *What is needed for these things to happen*?  
  
  A digital platform (because it is common to local community [businesses and homes] and a sustained public awareness campaign. We use lionfish because it does require timely action if we are to protect the 'seacology')   
    ]

.panel[.panel-name[Step 3. Assumptions]

 *Assumptions and Risks are established and made explicit for both Web portal & Lionfishery*:      

  * Assumption: A third party event management entity that is directly responsible to customers has more credibility with the punter than a government agency or the THTA
  * Assumption: Increasing the flow of online traffic in the tourism sector 
      - emphasises the logic of responsible use of resources to tourism stakeholders and actors in other sectors 
      - sensitises the public to the threat that is *Pterois volitans*
      - 'Responsibly' fished fish (lionfish and other species) can be sold over the Internet
      - sends the message to potential visitors that Tobago is positioning its tourism (at least in the marine space) for sustainability
  * Assumption: A common booking on-platform module will
      - increase the presence of available rooms as roomstock is not easy to find and or fact check outside Tobago
      - allow for [a measure] of standardisation for island services and properties  
]

.panel[.panel-name[Step 3. . ... Risks]

*Risks are established and made explicit for both Web portal & Lionfishery*:


  * Risk: The cost of running the web portal has to be covered by commissions from participating business    
  * Risk: 'Responsibly' caught lionfish has to financially viable for the operating entity to survive beyond the project's term

*Taking into account Assumptions and Risks, who are the partners actors most relevant to achieving each result*? 
  * Get In Touch Co
  * Environment Tobago
  * THTA

## Plan for slideshow

Separate the mini-projects Lionfish and Get In Touch web like;

**Logical Frame for Lionfishery project**

Useful and well understood for project proposing, implementation and reporting


**Theory of Change for Website.**

TOC helps to diagrammatically keep the bigger picture in sight wcwn as the discussions delve down to resource acquisition, usage and reporting.

## Of importance

What do the beneficiary destinations get?

Each selected destination will obtain:

- A personalized diagnosis of its level of technological readiness, based on its main challenges (*prioritized by the destinations themselves*); 

- A detailed action and pre-investment plan (*agreed between the public and private sector*) to accelerate technological assimilation at the destination. 

.footnote[Ten (10) destinations will be selected from; Trinidad and Tobago, Argentina, Barbados, Bahamas, Belize, Brazil, Bolivia, Nicaragua, Mexico, Jamaica, Honduras, Haiti, Guyana, Guatemala, El Salvador, Ecuador, Costa Rica, Columbia and Chile.]

---
## Selection criteria

Applicant (beneficiary destinations) must have;

1. A tourism org (*like TTAL, THATA*)

1. Duly signed letters of interest from key stakeholder groups

1. A dedicated team with active private-public sector reps.

1. a diagnosis of the destination (*ESG considerations*)

1. a tourism plan *in force*

---

## Selection process

Applications will be evaluated and scored (*closest to 60 pts*)

## Blue Economy 


>“An economic activity that directly or indirectly uses ocean or river resources as an input, and contributes or does not negatively affect the health and sustainability of ocean and river ecosystems. It emphasises conservation and sustainable management based on the idea that healthy ocean ecosystems are more productive and therefore fundamental to sustainable, ocean-based economies. Further, sustainable management implies that economic activity is in balance with the long-term capacity of ocean ecosystems to support such activity..”
